Project 3 for Biovisualization

1. The dataset I chose to use is Breast Cancer data from Wisconsin. It has 699 Instances and 10 Attributes(plus the class attribute).

2. To make my visualization, I read in all the data, and since most of the attributes has a range of numbers, I took a count of each number that occurs in the range and plotted it out on a bar chart.

3.My visualization COULD work with more than one dataset of the same type, but the labels would be off. 

4. I used the gicentre library for my barcharts, but other than that all the code is mine.

5. 
  Biological Significance:
   
    The biological significance of the additions I made would help to examine the data better into how the instances are  set. With this chart, it's really easy to see that the Bare Nuclei are mostly set at 1, which is significant because the presence of bare nuclei might be helpful in identifying whether the nature of the tumor is benign or not.

6. Running the programs

    1. In order to open the application on a linux machine, go to the folder project_1->application.linux(either 32 or 64 depending on your system). After that, pick the Project_3 file to run the program.
    
    During the running of the program:
      
      In order to view the Barcharts of a specific attribute, hover over the small window on the screen.
